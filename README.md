### Executive Summary
I successfully designed and launched a fully functional, AI-powered portfolio website using the Wix Studio platform. The goal was to build a client-ready site that not only looks professional but also integrates advanced AI features for content, design, and lead management. This project demonstrates practical skills in AI-enhanced no-code development and automation.

### Proof of AI Integration (Meeting All 4 Deliverables)

This project strictly adheres to the Task 2 requirement of integrating AI tools in four key areas:

#### 1. AI-Powered Design Suggestions
* **Method:** The entire site structure, including the **Visual Sitemap** (pages like Home, Services, Contact), was automatically generated by the **Wix AI Site Generator**.
* **Result:** This use of AI instantly established a professional, high-converting layout and a coherent branding style, fulfilling the design assistant requirement.

#### 2. Content Generation (AI-Written Text)
* **Method:** The primary marketing copy, main headlines ("Transforming AI Performance"), and service explanations (Design, Training, Support) were drafted using the **Wix AI Writer** during the initial setup.
* **Result:** This ensured fast content creation and a professional tone optimized for lead generation.

#### 3. Chatbot or FAQ Assistants
* **Tool:** **Wix AI Site Chat**
* **Implementation:** The chatbot is integrated on the live site and trained with **custom rules**. This setup demonstrates advanced prompting by enforcing a specific **Prompt Engineering Consultant Persona** and using **conditional logic** to redirect pricing inquiries to the Contact Form.

#### 4. Form/Data Automation using Zapier
* **Integration:** A workflow was established linking the Contact Form on the website to the **Zapier** automation tool.
* **Flow:** **Trigger:** New Form Submission (Wix Forms) → **Action:** Create Spreadsheet Row (Google Sheets).
* **Result:** This proves the ability to implement backend automation for lead management, which is a critical, client-ready business solution.
